    body: ` Colosseum [Colosseum Codex [Colosseum Codex: Solana Seeker, Encode Rust Bootcamp, WorldID on Solana [By Mike Hale • 20 Sept 2024View in browser [View in browser [📱 Solana SeekerSolana Mobile has come out of “Chapter 2” stealth to unveil Solana Seeker, the next-gen Web3 smartphone, set for release in 2025.Following the success of Saga, the Solana Seeker is designed to deliver a developer-friendly platform for the Web3 ecosystem. The Solana Seeker comes with several hardware upgrades tailored to the needs of Web3 users and developers. These include a lighter, brighter design, enhanced battery life, and better camera functionality to meet the needs of both developers and Web3 enthusiasts. For Solana developers, the Seeker offers the Solana dApp Store 2.0, which improves discoverability and provides a zero-fee platform for app deployment without the restrictive policies found on Google Play and Apple’s App Store.The Seeker’s Seed Vault Wallet, a native self-custodial crypto wallet, adds another layer of utility for developers. With the Seed Vault, developers can integrate crypto transactions and tokenized assets directly into their dApps with greater security and ease. Seeker also comes with enhanced access to internal device data like GPS and cellular information for developers building DePIN apps. 💬"We think Seeker will be the definitive Web3 mobile device when it comes out next year."~ Anatoly YakovenkoBy offering a specialized dApp store, crypto wallet integration, and hardware optimized for dApps, Seeker is creating a platform that pushes the boundaries of what mobile Web3 can offer. Solana Seeker [----------------------------------------👷‍♀️ Solana Rust BootcampApplications are open for the next round of Encode Club's Solana Rust Bootcamp, a free 6-week intensive online course starting on November 4th.The bootcamp covers Rust fundamentals, program development, deployment, and testing of on-chain programs.It’s designed for those with an understanding of programming and an interest in building on Solana.The curriculum includes weekly workshops, homework, and a final project, requiring commitment and active participation. The program emphasizes hands-on learning and collaboration in a group setting.The bootcamp includes: 1. Introduction to Solana/Rust 2. Rust/Development tools/Solana Token Program 3. Anchor Framework/DeFi/Security 4. Solana Program Library/NFTs 5. Workshop Week 6. Project WeekParticipants will gain advanced Solana skills and the opportunity to work on real-world projects.I was a part of a previous cohort, and I highly recommend this this for new and intermediate Solana developers.Encode Club's Solana Rust Bootcamp [----------------------------------------🌊 The Graph on SolanaThe Graph has released new enhancements to streamline Solana data access and accelerate dApp deployment. These upgrades provide Solana developers with simplified tools, such as Substreams-powered subgraphs and foundational modules, to easily index blockchain data. The improvements eliminate the need for complex setups or extensive coding knowledge, like Rust, and introduce a high-performance indexing engine that syncs data much faster. The developer experience includes ready-to-use subgraphs, code-free development options, and comprehensive documentation to enable efficient and scalable DApp creation on Solana’s high-speed network. The enhancements also offer improved scalability, decentralized reliability, and data integrity, helping developers avoid issues like vendor lock-in or service interruptions common in centralized solutions.These upgrades reflect The Graph’s commitment to supporting Solana and empowering web3 developers with decentralized, reliable infrastructure.To get started, developers can check out pre-deployed [ Substreams-powered subgraphs, read the documentation [ or join The Graph's Solana channel [ on Discord for support.Access Solana Data: Better, Faster, Stronger on The Graph [----------------------------------------👁️ World ID On SolanaWorld ID, a privacy-enabled "human verification" service from Worldcoin, has been integrated with the Solana blockchain via Wormhole, enabling developers to implement secure, real-human verification on Solana.Wormhole, with support from a Worldcoin Foundation grant, developed the cross-chain bridge that allows World IDs, originally verified on Ethereum, to be used on Solana. Wormhole’s infrastructure ensures seamless interoperability between the two blockchains. The integration is not fully live yet, as the smart contracts are currently being audited by Ackee Blockchain Security, with the audit expected to conclude in a few weeks.Solana developers can incorporate World ID’s biometric-based identity verification into their dApps that prioritize real human users, enhancing trust and security across the ecosystem and combating issues like bot proliferation.Worldcoin’s World IDs have made their way to Solana [----------------------------------------📈 Step v3 API UpdateWith the V3 update, Step positions itself as the go-to platform for tracking wallet performance and Solana on-chain activity.The launch of the Step Data API provides Solana developers with direct access to Step’s extensive set of protocol integrations built since 2021. The API allows developers to build new apps that offer real-time, scalable data on portfolio and transaction histories across Solana. Instead of building custom implementations and manually parsing on-chain data, developers can leverage Step’s infrastructure to integrate real-time financial data into their dApps.The API is built to handle large-scale data requests, making it perfect for enterprise-level applications, exchanges, and financial services.By leveraging the Step V3 pre-built API integrations developers can skip the need for building custom solutions for every project, allowing for quicker time-to-market.Step Finance V3 and API launch [----------------------------------------🔭 Fee Tracker Dashboard UpdatesSolscan announced updates to its Solana Fee Tracker dashboard, including several new features aimed at providing detailed insights into network performance and fee consumption: 1. Network Fee Tracking: The dashboard now allows users to monitor total daily vote fees, non-vote fees, and Jito tips. 2. Top Programs Consumption: A new section highlights total CUs and fees consumed by Solana programs within the current block, similar to the Priority Fee Tracker, to help users track top-performing programs. 3. Top Spender Consumption: The dashboard introduces a ranking of the top 100 wallets that spend the most on gas fees, along with their priority fee portions over time.The Fee Tracker is available in beta via Solscan Analytics [Re-Releasing Solana Fee Tracker Dashboard [----------------------------------------⚡ Quick HitsZK Compression is now live on Solana Mainnet-Beta [ - @LightProtocolSolana Web3.js 2.0: A New Chapter in Solana Development [ - QuickNodeKinobi 101: An IDL to generate user interfaces & CLIs for Solana programs [ - @rexstjohnAnnouncing the Step Data API for Wallet Positions, Historical Transactions, and NFT Data on Solana [ - @StepFinance_Phantom Rolls Out Custom Usernames, Paving the Way for Easier Web3 Onboarding [ - SolanaFloorHow to update Solana CLI to use the Agave installer [ - @nickfrostyWTF Are SPL 404/Hybrid NFTs?
